# Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python-Course-Assignments
# Description:
This repository contains Ipython notebooks of assignments I completed in the course [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis?specialization=data-science-python),
part of [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) from University of Michigan offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course will introduce the learner to network analysis through tutorials using the NetworkX library. The course begins with an understanding of what network analysis is and motivations for why we might model phenomena as networks. The second week introduces the concept of connectivity and network robustness. The third week will explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. The final week will explore the evolution of networks over time and cover models of network generation and the link prediction problem.
# Requirements:
- Python3.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- Libraries.
  - pandas.
  - numpy.
  - networkx.
  - sklearn.
  - pickle

# Repository go through:
1. There is a main directory in this repository.
2. All the Assignments and projects files in this course are present in Ipyton notebook format.
3. Subdirectory named [readonly](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python-Course-Assignments/tree/main/readonly) contains all the necessary files needed for these assignments.
# Final Course Project:
- Final Project of this course is named as [Assignment+4](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python-Course-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%2B4.ipynb) as it was 4th assignment for the course as well.
- This Assignment is divided into 2 parts.
  - For the first part of this assignment,I analyzed randomly generated graphs and determined which algorithm created them.
  - For the second part of this assignment,I worked with a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.
# Reason to upload:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
